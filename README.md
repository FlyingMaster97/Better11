Current Status:

11/12/2022: I am still working on this. I haven't released an update in a while, but that's because of a couple factors. The first one, Im currently working on Better11 V3.0, but this update is HUGE! It adds so much more features! The second factor, is the Windows 11 22H2 update. This update may of made some of the registry hacks nonfunctional. I haven't tested Better11 V3.0 on 22H2 for a while until I finally updated. The third and final factor is just being busy. I have to work on a lot in school and when I don't, I usually don't feel motivated to do it. However, now I've started getting more time, and started chipping away at the project.
